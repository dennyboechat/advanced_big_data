Lab 1: Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, and Statistical Analysis Using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Lab Purpose
This project focuses on performing a complete data analysis workflow using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. 
The goal is to collect a dataset, exploring it visually, preprocessing the data, and applying statistical analysis techniques.

## Key Insights
Data Visualization 

The scatter plot of Total Finished Area vs. Sale Price reveals a positive correlation, suggesting that properties with larger finished areas generally sell for higher prices. However, the data also shows some dispersion, especially at higher price points, indicating that other factors—such as location or land use—may also significantly influence sale prices.

In the bar chart, we see clear differences in average Sale Price across land use categories. For example, properties classified as "ONE FAMILY" tend to have a moderate average sale price, while certain other categories like "COMMERCIAL" or "MULTI FAMILY" may exhibit higher or lower averages depending on market demand and property characteristics. These comparisons highlight how property classification plays a key role in real estate valuation and can guide investment or policy decisions based on land use trends.

## Challenges
First challenge was getting Pandas work. I realized it needed to be installed separatelly. Same for matplotlib package.

Some sintax problems, but nothing major.
